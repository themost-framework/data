# Define associations

Each model can have associations with other models. There are 4 types of associations:

## Many to One

Defines a many-to-one association between two models. For example, a `Product` has many `Order`s.

```json
{
    "name": "orderedItem",
    "type": "Product",
    "expandable": false,
    "many": false,
    "mapping": {
        "parentModel": "Product",
        "parentField": "id",
        "associationType": "association",
        "cascade": "null"
    }
}
```

where `mapping` attribute holds the information about the association.

These attributes are optional and can be omitted. A shorthand for the above association is:

```json
{
    "name": "orderedItem",
    "type": "Product"
}
```

where `type` attribute is the name of the model that is associated with the current model e.g. an `Order` has a `Product` as an `orderedItem` and the association is defined in the `Order` model by using `id` field of the `Product` model.

## One to Many

Defines a one-to-many association between two models. For example, a `Product` has many `Order`s.

```json
{
    "name": "orders",
    "type": "Order",
    "expandable": false,
    "many": true,
    "mapping": {
        "parentModel": "Product",
        "parentField": "id",
        "childModel": "Order",
        "childField": "orderedItem",
        "associationType": "association",
        "cascade": "delete"
    }
}
```

where `mapping` attribute holds the information about the association:

> parentModel - the model that has the association

> parentField - the field of the parent model that is used for the association

> childModel - the model that is associated with the parent model

> childField - the field of the child model that is used for the association

> cascade - the cascade type for the association. Can be `delete` or `null`

`parentModel` and `parentField` are optional and can be omitted. A shorthand for the above association is:

```json
{
    "name": "orders",
    "type": "Order",
    "many": true,
    "mapping": {
        "childModel": "Order",
        "childField": "orderedItem",
        "associationType": "association",
        "cascade": "delete"
    }
}
```

where `type` attribute is the name of the model that is associated with the current model e.g. a `Product` has many `Order`s and the association is defined in the `Product` model by using `id` field of the `Product` model.

## Many to Many

Defines a many-to-many association between two models. For example, a `User` has many `Group`s.

```json
{
    "name": "groups",
    "type": "Group",
    "mapping": {
        "associationAdapter":"GroupMembers",
        "parentModel":"Group",
        "parentField":"id",
        "childModel":"User",
        "childField":"id",
        "associationType":"junction",
        "cascade":"delete"
    }
}
```

where `mapping` attribute holds the information about the association:

> associationAdapter - the name of the adapter that is used for the association

> parentModel - the model that has the association

> parentField - the field of the parent model that is used for the association

> childModel - the model that is associated with the parent model

> childField - the field of the child model that is used for the association

> cascade - the cascade type for the association. Can be `delete` or `none`. When the cascade is `delete`, then the associations are removed when the parent object or the child object is deleted.

> associationType - the type of the association. It must be `junction` for many-to-many associations

`parentField` and `childField` are optional and can be omitted. A shorthand for the above association is:

```json
{
    "name": "groups",
    "type": "Group",
    "mapping": {
        "associationAdapter":"GroupMembers",
        "associationType":"junction",
        "cascade":"delete"
    }
}
```

where `type` attribute is the name of the model that is associated with the current model e.g. a `User` has many `Group`s and the association is defined in the `User` model by using `id` field of the `User` model.

The `associationAdapter` is used to define the name of the database object that is going to be used for the association. For example, if the `associationAdapter` is `GroupMembers`, then the database object for the association will be `GroupMembers`. This table will have two fields: `parentId` and `valueId`. The `parentId` is the id of the parent model and the `valueId` is the id of the child model. 

The field names `parentId` and `valueId` are customizable and can be configured:

```json

{
    "name": "groups",
    "type": "Group",
    "mapping": {
        "associationAdapter":"GroupMembers",
        "associationObjectField": "group",
        "associationValueField": "user",
        "associationType":"junction",
        "cascade":"delete"
    }
}

```

where `associationObjectField` holds the name of the field that is going to be used for the parent model and `associationValueField` is the name of the field that is going to be used for the child model.

A many-to-many association can be defined in the parent model e.g. `Group` as well:

```json
{
    "name": "members",
    "type": "User",
    "mapping": {
        "associationAdapter":"GroupMembers",
        "associationObjectField": "group",
        "associationValueField": "user",
        "associationType":"junction",
        "cascade":"delete"
    }
}
```

## One to One

Defines an one-to-one association between two models. For example, a `Product` has one `ProductDimension`.

```json
{
    "name": "productDimensions",
    "type": "ProductDimension",
    "nested": true,
    "expandable": true,
    "multiplicity": "ZeroOrOne",
    "mapping": {
        "parentModel": "Product",
        "parentField": "id",
        "childModel": "ProductDimension",
        "childField": "product",
        "associationType": "association",
        "cascade": "delete"
    }
}
```

The child model has a field that holds the id of the parent model. For example, the `ProductDimension` model has a field `product` that holds the id of the `Product` model.

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://themost-framework.github.io/themost/models/2018/2/schema.json",
    "name": "ProductDimension",
    "version": "2.0",
    "inherits": "StructuredValue",
    "fields": [
        {
            "name": "width",
            "type": "Number",
            "nullable": false
        },
        {
            "name": "height",
            "type": "Number",
            "nullable": false
        },
        {
            "name": "product",
            "type": "Product"
        }
    ],
    "constraints": [
        {
            "type": "unique",
            "fields": [
                "product"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

The attribute `constraints` is used to define a unique constraint for the field `product`. This constraint ensures that a `ProductDimension` can be associated with only one `Product`.
