# Create a simple data model

This tutorial will show you how to create a simple data model schema.

## Create a data model

To create a data model, you need to create a new file in the `config/models` directory. The file name will be the name of the data model. For example, if you want to create a data model called `Product`, you need to create a file called `Product.json`.

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://themost-framework.github.io/themost/models/2018/2/schema.json",
    "name": "Product",
    "version": "2.1",
    "inherits": "Thing",
}
```

The `name` property is the name of the data model. The `version` property is the version of the data model. The `inherits` property is the name of the base data model. In this example, the `Product` data model inherits from the `Thing` data model. The `Thing` data model is a built-in data model that is used to represent any object in the system.

Important Note: Don't forget to use `$schema` property as `https://themost-framework.github.io/themost/models/2018/2/schema.json` in order to enable intellisense in your editor.

Let's see the json schema of `Thing` model

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://themost-framework.github.io/themost/models/2018/2/schema.json",

            "calculation": "javascript:return this.user();"
        }
    ]
}
```

The `fields` property is an array of fields. Each field has a name, a type, and other properties. The `name` property is the name of the field. The `type` property is the type of the field. The `value` property is the default value of the field. The `readonly` property indicates whether the field is read-only. The `primary` property indicates whether the field is a primary key. The `calculation` property is a function that is used to calculate the value of the field.

Note: If you want to read more about the `Thing` data model, you can read the [schema.org](https://schema.org/Thing) documentation.

### Database schema

Each one of these fields are going to be represented as a column in the database table  e.g. `ThingBase` where the `id` field is the primary key of the table. The `dateCreated` field is the date on which the record was created. The `dateModified` field is the date on which the record was last modified. The `createdBy` field is the user who created the record. The `modifiedBy` field is the user who last modified the record.

 Each data model will have a corresponding table in the database which will be used to store the data of the data model. e.g. The `Product` data model will have a corresponding `ProductBase` table in the database. The `source` attribute of the data model is used to specify the name of the database table. If you don't specify the `source` attribute, the name of the database table will be the name of the data model with the suffix `Base`. 
 
 ![ProductBase](./images/ProductBaseTable.png)

 `ProductBase` table will have a foreign key to the `ThingBase` table. This foreign key will be used to represent the inheritance of the `Product` data model from the `Thing` data model.
 
 This table will be created automatically by the `@themost/data` module each time that you are upgrading your data model by increasing the `version` attribute. `@themost/data` data migration engine will automatically add new fields, remove unused fields or update existing ones.

`@themost/data`  will automatically create also a database view for each data model e.g. The `Product` data model will have a corresponding `ProductData` database view in the database. The `view` attribute of the data model is used to specify the name of the database view. If you don't specify the `view` attribute, the name of the database view will be the name of the data model with the suffix `Data`.

This database view will be used to query the data of the data model. It will be a join of a data model and its inherited model e.g.  the `ProductBase` table which represents `Product` with the `ThingBase` table which represents `Thing`.

### Define fields

Each data model has a set of fields. The type of each field can be a primitive type, such as `Text`, `Date`, `Number`, or a reference to another data model.

The following json schema represents `Product` model and defines all extra fields that represent this model which inherits `Thing`.

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://themost-framework.github.io/themost/models/2018/2/schema.json",
    "name": "Product",
    "version": "2.1",
    "inherits": "Thing",
    "fields": [
        {
            "name": "category",
            "title": "Category",
            "description": "A category related to this product.",
            "type": "Text"
        },
        {
            "name": "discontinued",
            "title": "Discontinued",
            "description": "Indicates whether this product is discontinued or not.",
            "type": "Boolean"
        },
        {
            "name": "price",
            "title": "Price",
            "description": "The price of the product.",
            "type": "Number"
        },
        {
            "name": "isRelatedTo",
            "title": "Is Related to",
            "description": "A pointer to another, somehow related product (or multiple products).",
            "type": "Product"
        },
        {
            "name": "isSimilarTo",
            "title": "Is Similar to",
            "description": "A pointer to another, functionally similar product (or multiple products).",
            "type": "Product"
        },
        {
            "name": "model",
            "title": "Model",
            "description": "The model of the product. Use with the URL of a ProductModel or a textual representation of the model identifier. The URL of the ProductModel can be from an external source. It is recommended to additionally provide strong product identifiers via the gtin8/gtin13/gtin14 and mpn properties.",
            "type": "Text"
        },
        {
            "name": "productID",
            "title": "Product ID",
            "description": "The product identifier, such as ISBN. For example: <code>&lt;meta itemprop='productID' content='isbn:123-456-789'/&gt;</code>.",
            "type": "Text"
        },
        {
            "name": "releaseDate",
            "title": "Release Date",
            "description": "The release date of a product or product model. This can be used to distinguish the exact variant of a product.",
            "type": "Date"
        }
    ]
}
```
